 f
 inancial industry. High dependence on internet technology leads

 are done through credit cards and net banking.Many techniques
 have been proposed to tackle this problem. This paper  mainly
 focus on recognizing fraudulent transactions by analyzing the
 previous set of transaction records. This research work attempts
 to integrate big data analytics along with machine algorithms for
 fast detection of large real-time data. This paper gives a brief
